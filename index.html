			More than half of the Nation’s superfund sites – places deemed to be polluted with harmful chemicals, wastes or industrial byproducts by the EPA – are considered vulnerable to climate change. 
		</p>
			A 2019 study from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that 945 out of 1,571 active and formerly listed non-federal National Priorities List (NPL) superfund sites that year were put at-risk from events like floods and wildfires. Sites on the NPL list can be in varying states of the clean-up process, from undergoing preliminary environmental surveys to actively builidng protective infrasture. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			The GAO went on to publish a 2021 report urging the EPA to better incorporate these risks in their superfund management efforts. And since then, the agency has added some climate-resiliancy considerations to their superfund program.
		</p>
			Climate scientists have also been warning us that rising sea-levels and more extreme weather could heavily damage these sites. A 2020 report published by The Union of Concerned Scientists made it clear that there are many reasons to care about what happens to superfund sites in our warming world, including our own health and safety and that of local ecology.
		</p>
		<p>
			And in 2023, having already experienced the hottest July on record, and seeing hurricanes pummel the East Coast with high winds and heavy rains, that 2020 report still feels relevant.  
		</p>
			I spoke with Jacob Carter, the report author and Research Director at The Union of Concerned Scientists, to understand what some of the main concerns about superfund sites and our warming world are. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's what you need to know.

					There are two main concerns that are uniquely risky for superfund sites, and both have to do with water. <strong> First, </strong> the sea-level rise caused by melting ice caps is causing the available, above-water coastline to shrink. More available sea-water is also generating more extreme flooding along the coasts. <strong> Second, </strong> warmer ocean temperatures are giving more energy to storms, acting like fuel for hurricanes and tropical cyclones. These higher energy storms dump more rainwater on land, and cause more intense storm surge flooding.

				<p class="icon-caption"> <!--paragraph below icon--> 
					About <strong> 2,000 </strong> current and former superfund sites are <strong> within 25 miles </strong> from the East or Gulf Coast. And certain states, particularly, New Jersey, New York and Florida, had more sites along the coast. When looking on a map, these sites are clustered most densely along the Atlantic Ocean coastline, in areas that are <strong> also highly vulnerable </strong> to the worsening water-based weather patterns. And, when predicting a <strong> high sea-level rise scenario, </strong> the scientists found that <strong> 71% of sites within 10 miles </strong> of the East or Gulf coast would be at-risk of flooding.

				<h4><mark>Danger to Public Health</mark></h4>
				<img src="Images/Publichealthdanger.png" alt="Skull">
				<p class="icon-caption"> <!--paragraph below icon--> 
					Flooding at some sites could potentially pose a health risk, by washing dangerous, sometimes carcinogenic materials into nearby communities. Most actively listed superfund sites are <strong> still undergoing remediation efforts, </strong> and may not have the adequate infrastructure in place to prevent floodwaters from damaging containment areas. Some former sites may also be vulnerable to spreading waste, if the harmful materials were “capped” in place. There are concerns that the coverings used in this method, while formerly a standard EPA practice, <strong>may not be impenetrable from harsh weather and flooding. </strong>

				<h4><mark>Unjust Impact</mark></h4>

				<p class="icon-caption"> <!--paragraph below icon--> 
					In that same <strong> high sea-level rise scenario, </strong> the researchers found that within 20 years, about <strong> 2.5 million more people of color </strong> would live within 5-miles of a superfund site, and within 40 years, about <strong> 2.5 million more low-income households than expected </strong> would live within 5-miles of a superfund site undergoing extreme flooding. Overall, low-income communities and communities of color would be most disproportionately affected by superfund flooding.
